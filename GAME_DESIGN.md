# Game Design Document

## Core Mechanics

### Territory Control
- One territory= 1 pixel
- Use army to claim territories
- Territories generate resources over time

### Resources & Economy
**Primary Resources:**
- Manpower (for armies)
- Materials (for buildings/tech)
- Energy (for special abilities)
- Gold (Main currency)

### Economy
- Buildings for economy
- Mines, factories, cities, Ports, Capital
- Ports send trading ships and battleships
- Turrets defend against armies and transport ships
- Allies get trading buff (Increased gold gain)
- Betraying allies give penalties
  
### Army System
- Deploy troops to adjacent territories
- Troop maintenance costs
- Combined arms (different unit types)
- Max troop count per pixel owned

### Research Tree
- Military techs (better units)
- Economic techs (more resources)
- Special abilities (temporary boosts)

## Game Flow
1. Start with small territory
2. Expand while managing economy
